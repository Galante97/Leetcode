/*
 * 162. Find Peak Element
 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
 * Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If
 * the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 * Example 1:
    * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    * Output: 2
    * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index
    * number 2.
